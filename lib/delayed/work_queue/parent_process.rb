    # ParentProcess is a WorkQueue implementation that spawns a separate worker
    # process for querying the queue. Each Worker child process sends requests to
    # the ParentProcess via IPC, and receives responses. This centralized queue
    # querying cuts down on db queries and lock contention, and allows the
    # possibility for other centralized logic such as notifications when all workers
    # are idle.
    #
    # The IPC implementation uses Unix stream sockets and Ruby's built-in Marshal
    # functionality. The ParentProcess creates a Unix socket on the filesystem in
    # the tmp directory, so that if a worker process dies and is restarted it can
    # reconnect to the socket.
    #
    # While Unix and IP sockets are API compatible, we take a lot of shortcuts
    # because we know it's just a local Unix socket. If we ever wanted to swap this
    # out for a TCP/IP socket and have the WorkQueue running on another host, we'd
    # want to be a lot more robust about partial reads/writes and timeouts.
